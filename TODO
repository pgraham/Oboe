Purpose:
--------
As this library has become quite outdated, and was probably never 'right' to
begin with, some major changes are planned.  The focus of development will now
be on restructuring the class hierarchy to better conform with HTML5
restrictions, and also to make it easier/more efficient to query a given
structure, kindaof like a server side DOM implementation.


Conventions:
------------

  This section lists some convensions that will be implemented moving forward.

  - Constructors for concrete class accept no parameters for which a setter has
    been defined.
  - All methods that do not return a value will return $this to support method
    chaining.

TODO:
------

- Implement a fieldset element.

  http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-fieldset-element

  Notes:
  ------
  - Content Model: Optionally a legend element, followed by flow content.
  - The name of the group is given by the first legend element that is a child
    of the fieldset element, if any.
  - The form attribute is used to explicitly associate the fieldset element with
    its form owner.
  - Interface should allow any FlowContent to be added.  The optional legend
    element should be added through an interface method specifically for that
    purpose.

- Implement interface that makes it easy for concrete classes to define their
  accepted attributes.

 - Implement FormAssociated interface in the attr package that defines getter/
   setters for the element's associated form

-- Low priority items are listed beneath this line
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Rename item\Body, item\Head, etc. to item\BodyItem, item\HeadItem, etc.
- Add addToBody method to Item\Body interface and addToHead method to Item\Head   interface.
- Figure out a way to allow form items to be added to a table.
